# SDN-Controller-Placement
This source code can be used to optimize SDN controller placement in wide area networks.
The algorithms used are classical partitional algorithms namely Silhouette and Gap Statistic to determine the optimal number of controllers to deploy and PAM to find the optimal locations to place the controllers.
